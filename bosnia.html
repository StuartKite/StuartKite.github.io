    <h2>
      From Bosnia to Canada
    </h2>
       <p>
      There was to be no traditional encore for the adoring fans of Amira Medunjanin’s concert.
She made that clear, then invited four men from the small but tightly packed audience of no more than 100 to come on stage in the Commons theatre Feb. 8.
</p>
<p>
The men got up and disappeared among the wings of the theatre, then reappeared with instruments.
One had an accordion. Two held acoustic guitars. The fourth sat down in the middle of the stage on a cajón, a box-like percussion instrument played by striking the sides.
They added their sounds to the final two songs, accompanying Medunjanin and her band comprised of bassist Zvonimir Sestakon and guitarist Ante Gelo.
</p>
<p>
They were jamming, playing and having fun. Not performing.
That is what made Medunjanin’s concert so special. It was not a concert. It was social gathering. It resembled the atmosphere of songs around a campfire for the sake of song and sentiment; to celebrate the heritage, long standing tradition and emotions that the songs carry.

“The true faces of [Bosnian] people are these songs,” Medunjanin said.
</p>
<p>
Medunjanin performed to a crowd entirely composed of people with Bosnian ties. They had all come to witness what is seldom heard or performed in Canada; a traditional form of music called Sevdah.
“It’s music that describes the deepest human emotions,” she said. “Lessons on how be a good person, how to love honestly, how to be sincere to yourself and to everyone
around you.”
</p>
<p>
Sevdah is deeply rooted in the history of
Bosnia and Herzegovina. Sevdah songs are up to five centuries old and were passed on verbally to the next generations. The word Sevdah comes from two sources, one originating in Turkish as love, another from ancient Arabic and Greek doctors for “black gall.” A basic substance believed to reside in the human body responsible for melancholic emotions.
</p>
<p>
“There’s a certain emotion and a certain feeling that connects on a human level,” said Bojan Dodik about the music. Dodik is a young man of Bosnian heritage but was raised in Canada. He was not surrounded by this music growing up and appreciates the opportunity to experience and share it with the community here.
“It makes the experience of being a Canadian that much richer. Having what we have, where we’ve come from and sharing it with Canadian friends...that’s why I love Canada.”
</p>
<p>
These messages remain important after the tragedies in the Bosnian War of 1992-1995. Tensions rose during a push
for independence from Yugoslavia, and a bloody war charged with an ethnic cleansing of Bosnians followed. The fighting left over 100,000 dead. The capital of Sarajevo, where Medunjanin is from, was put under siege for 1,425 days.
Many people found sanctuary from the violence in Canada.

“They started a new life here, but didn’t forget their homeland,” said Kovilijka Špirić, the ambassador for Bosnia and Herzegovina. “You can go anywhere the light will take you, but you are born in only one place.”
</p>
<p>
The pain and love lost from this time is heard in the voice of Medunjanin as she sang. The words carried immense emotional weight that can be felt even by those who do not understand the language.
For those who do, it is an emotional evening. Tears could be seen on some faces in the crowd, but smiles never disappeared from any of them.
</p>
<p>
Medunjanin has a personal connection with Canada. During the war, a majority of her friends came here as refugees where they found a new life.
</p>
<p>
“My friends were accepted. Some of my family lives here and they were accepted as equals. Immediately, this country becomes my friend, because they embraced my friends.”
<p>
That connection with Canada is what has made this experience so special. Medunjanin talked about how she was seeing a
friend from primary school for the first time in over 20 years. She says it doesn’t feel like a tour.
</p>
<p>
“I am here to visit my friends and family, and to socialize through music. It’s an amazing thing.”
</p>
<p>
It was a welcoming show that made outsiders feel at home, somewhat echoing what Canada did for the refugees during the war. That does not mean the show was somber. Laughter was a common element as Medunjanin found pleasure talking to the audience in Bosnian, who would gleefully shout retorts back.
</p>
<p>
She revelled in the opportunity to share her music with them, so far away from home. “It really does belong to the world’s musical heritage. It’s not ours anymore. It’s too precious, you cannot hold it for yourself. You have to share it with people because it’s
beautiful.”
</p>
<p>
Littered with emotion, history, great music and love. A small but deep look into the experience and culture of Bosnian life.
As the four men came on stage to close out the show, Medunjanin told the story of how she met them. It was just the day before, at the Embassy of Bosnia and Herzegovina, where to her surprise she was welcomed by Ottawa’s Bosnian community.
She returned the favour and the four men played, Medunjanin sang and the tradition continued.
