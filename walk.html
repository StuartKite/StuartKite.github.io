    <h2>
      Walking Across Ottawa
    </h2>
    <p>
One step after another.
</p>
<p>
I am walking on the shoulder of Carling Avenue, the section between Moodie Drive and March Road. I am screaming with each step. Passing cyclists turn and stare at me as they go by, some in disgust due to the language pouring out of my dry mouth. Every time I put a foot down it feels like stepping onto a red-hot bed of nails. I am convinced my ankles and knees have turned into concrete. I am out of food, nearly out of water. The phone in my jacket rings, it is my concerned mother.
</p>
<p>
“Fuck off! Fuck off! Fuck off! Fuck off!” I yell. Nothing is stopping me at this point. 
</p>
<p>
I don’t know if I am going to make it anymore, but I didn’t come this far to come up short.
</p>
<p>
One painful step after another.
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
I have always been a walker. Living in downtown Ottawa the past three years, I walk everywhere, even when it would be faster to take the bus. But these walks are modest, never taking much longer than an hour at most. Inspired by Canada’s 150 celebrations, I wanted to take it further, literally, by walking across Ottawa starting at Place d’Orleans and finishing in Kanata. 
</p>
<p>
I began to plan my route, deciding which paths I would take, what landmarks I would see and what combination of these two things would be the most walker friendly. This plan was scrapped immediately after talking to Dan Rubinstein, author of Born to Walk: The Transformative Power of a Pedestrian Act and Ottawa local who has logged many kilometres walking across the U.S., U.K. and Canada. He has advocated for not just the obvious physical benefits of walking, but the psychological benefits as well.
</p>
<p>
“A sense of yourself and how you fit into the environment of where you are,” was one of the many benefits he told me walking can bring. “The less we walk the more we engage with the world in fast moving vehicles or digitally, the less connected we are to the people and places around us.” 
</p>
<p>
I asked him what he has benefitted the most from walking and he replied with a very simple answer.
</p>
<p>
“It has made me happier.”
</p>
<p>
He also explained how walking can benefit creativity. Your perspective slowly changes with each step, constantly providing a new way to look at things. 
</p>
<p>
“That allows you to think about other things, problems, challenges and struggles differently. If not to come up with solutions, it is just to understand things a bit more.”
</p>
<p>
“Whoa,” was all I could muster as a reply. Eventually I was able to mouth words again and asked for advice on my route.
</p>
<p>
“Be open to serendipity, just to discover what you discover along the way,” he said to, “go through ‘boring and unassuming’ places where you don’t know anything about them, because you never know what you are going to see along the way.” 
</p>
<p>
That stuck with me. I scrapped my route on the spot, seeing my old plan as no different then planning a drive across Ottawa. My new plan was to pick a starting place and a wide finish line of anywhere in Kanata. You could call it a freestyle approach to the route encouraging detours and exploration. Also on Rubinstein’s advice, I would forgo any navigational aid. No maps, no compasses, no GPS. I would be free to take my feet wherever my curiosity took me.
</p>
<p>
The day before my walk, I went to the Running Room for some walking shoes and supplies. Laurence Wright of the Running Room (who was very helpful, possibly because I was saying “I have no idea what I am doing” a lot) Rubinstein and my friend Dylan Jones who graduated from Algonquin’s outdoor adventure program all advised me that using brand new shoes was a bad idea. I stubbornly thought it was a very good idea anyways because anything must be better then my current shoes, which when worn contained more holes than feet. 
</p>
<p>
On top of new shoes, I got socks that will keep my feet dry, a water bottle, a whole assortment of energy and protein snacks and most importantly anti-chaffing cream. I have never been so aware of information being told to me as Lawrence explained where and how to apply the cream. 
</p>
<p>
“The most important part,” I said as he handed it to me.
</p>

</p>
<p>
Oh jeez what have I gotten myself into.
</p>
<p>
The city and its surrounding fields flew past as I looked out the window of the car, seemingly forever, as I headed to my starting point at Place d’Orleans from downtown. 
</p>
<p>
This is way further then I thought.
</p>
<p>
I was starting to get nervous. I began to wonder if I was in over my head, if my lack of training would drag me down and if I had any right even attempting it. I began to be incredibly aware of my body, every little joint or muscle that did not feel 100 per cent became like a nefarious voice whispering in my ear that they would drag me down. 
</p>
<p>
If I have to poo at one point that is going to be problematic. 
</p>
<p>
I try not to think about any of it and focus on downing my Solo mocha fudge energy bar and Tim Hortons coffee. The weather report on the radio said it was going to be a beautiful day. 
</p>
<p>
Damn right it is. 
</p>
<p>
I reach the deserted parking lot of the Place d’Orleans mall at 7:30 a.m. thanks to the very kind lift my mom offered me. I grew up in Kanata and I think this was the first time I actually got out of a car and put feet on the ground in Orleans. If it was not for the Queensway nearby, I would have had no idea which direction to take my first step. I did know the river was not too far away, so I headed north through the suburbs. 
</p>
<p>
It is weird how fast the feeling hit me. 
</p>
<p>
I am free. I can go where ever I want. I have all day to explore.
</p>
<p>
It was a powerful feeling. I was not going to the store and back, I was roaming. I left the sidewalks and walked through the very first field I saw from Champlain Street. I laughed to myself at the irony of getting a strong sense freedom in a suburb. I eventually made it all the way to the path that goes along the river after cutting through parks and school grounds by hopping some fences.
</p>
<p>
Dan would be proud.
</p>
<p>
I reach the first major landmark of my trek, the great Ottawa River. It also leads to my first experience with other runners and walkers using the path along the river as well. Everyone was so nice! I pet at least five different dogs who were super happy to see me and exchanged “good mornings” with smiles. Pretty much everyone who I passed by exchanged good mornings with me. When I was not socializing, I was captivated by the river. The morning was incredibly still, the water a mirror for the clear sky, causing the gradients to collide on the horizon. Incredible. Who ever thought a boy from Kanata would be amazed by Orleans?
</p>
<p>
At 8:50 a.m. I took my first quick break. I was in sight of my own recognizable landmark, the communications tower at Camp Fortune way in the distance. Not really notable or a help in navigation, but it was comforting to see something I can also see from my apartment window. In bad news, my decision to ignore the advice on shoes was starting to be regretted. Blisters were beginning to form on the insides of both heels. I tried to adjust the shoe hoping for some relief from the discomfort. To my amusement it actually worked, but to my dismay only for a few minutes. 
</p>
<p>
The river path eventually takes a turn away from the river and detours into a small wooded area. My head was on a swivel here. Everywhere I looked there was something worth looking at. A small creek down below, fallen trees, standing trees, trees that have fallen but remain held up by standing trees. It was all here. Dan’s point about perspective changing while walking became stuck in my head. I focused on one tree and watched the branches on it slowly rotate as I walked by. I hate the fact that I am about to compare it to technology but it was like I had put 3D glasses on.
</p>
<p>
I am forced to sit on a bench as at this point my heels are starting to feel more and more painful and I can not walk properly anymore. I remove my shoes and socks to reveal two massive blisters covering the most of each heel. 
</p>
<p>
“Blisters?” a man said while jogging by, never breaking a stride.
</p>
<p>
“Yeah.”
</p>
<p>
“Ouch.”
</p>
<p>
In the best decision I made all day, I break and clear them out. It hurt for another hour or so, but the pain went away. 
</p>
<p>
I have to move away from the river path at this point due to flooding. I decide to rough it in the woods, eventually making out of the woods around Rockcliffe.
</p>
<p>
I take another rest at the Rockcliffe Lookout. It’s 11:00 a.m. at this point. I have never seen this vista before or even knew of its existence. An elevated view over the river into the shores of Gatineau. Breathtaking. Despite these wonderful views, I find myself more motivated to keep moving, fearing that remaining stationary would hurt more then it would help.
</p>
<p>
Out of Rockcliffe I moved up Sussex Drive. I lean into the bars at 24 Sussex hoping to catch a glimpse of someone notable. Nothing. A bit further along I spend time at Rideau Falls, another Ottawa landmark that I have never seen. The water is powerful. I stare for a few minutes before I realize I should most likely not mess around.
</p>
<p>
At noon I make it downtown. It was amazing watching the skyline reveal itself on the approach. Buildings popped in and out of view, giving a different picture to look at every block. It is familiar scenery but today it looks incredibly vibrant. I rest at Parliament, and it is at this time I notice my feet are starting to go numb, but not enough for me to think anything else of it. That feeling did not last much longer. 
</p>
<p>
I make it to Lebreton Flats at 12:20 p.m. and take another rest. This was the shortest distance I’ve done so far between rests. The numbness in my feet has now escalated into pain. Putting a foot down on anything that is not perfectly flat and level just multiplies the sensation. My strides are now accompanied by a limp. I realize the true value in deciding not to use a map. I have no idea how many kilometres further I have to go. 
</p>
<p>
From Lebreton I worked my way past the slants of the Canadian War Museum, following the river once again to my favourite picnic spot gone illegal: Prince of Wales Bridge. This was only another 20 or so minutes of walking, but my feet have become twice as painful as before. I make it to the Sir John A. Macdonald Parkway near Mechanicsville and decide to change my plans.
</p>
<p>
Up until this point, I was a wide-eyed walker. Soaking in everything around me, seeing the beauty in each street corner. Self-reflecting thoughts flew through my mind, allowing everything that I was hung up on to pass by me. The constant forward motion and change in scenery aided in all this. Now things were different. I set myself a task that I felt I needed to complete. I was past the midway mark and would never forgive myself for not trying my best to finish. The exploratory thoughts were gone. I take one look at the parkway and all the curves and turns it takes and I think:
</p>
<p>
No way in hell. I need efficiency. 
</p>
<p>
I cut though Tunney’s Pasture to Wellington Street West. First time I was happy to see a sidewalk in a straight line. It is about 1:30 p.m., I have been walking for six hours so far. I mentally feel fine. I still have energy and food, it’s just the pain in my feet slowing me down. About a half-hour later my knees start to go. Any meditative state I held or calmness I had is gone. I tell myself this is no longer a sightseeing tour. This is now an endurance test. 
</p>
<p>
I move out of Wellington and make it to Richmond Road. My phone rings, it is my friend Dylan (and Michelle on speaker) calling to check up on me. I don’t think they understood how much that call meant. I had been alone walking for seven hours and being able to talk casually with friends gave me a lot of motivation. Dylan told me I could do it, he told me what I had already done was something to be proud of. Thanks Dylan and Michelle, you saved me. I hope you enjoyed your meal at Zak’s Diner. 
</p>
<p>
At 3:00 p.m. I am resting at Carling Avenue by the Cineplex. My feet are noticeably swollen. I write in my notebook that I am not sure how much more I could physically do, but I had the willpower to see how far I could go. I have seen Kanata in the distance, it was now obtainable. 
</p>
<p>
As I start back up I find myself thinking about the Stanley Cup Playoffs:
</p>
<p>
The playoffs are about giving your all when you have nothing else to give. Reaching your goal after giving everything you got makes it mean that much more. There is no satisfaction in setting a goal with the expectation of it being easy.
</p>
<p>
Andrew Haydon Park, 3:30 p.m., my mom shows up with a car to check in on me. I am telling her about my physical state, she offers the choice for me to stop. To get in the car, grab some McDonald’s and be sitting on a couch with my legs up all in under 30 minutes. 
</p>
<p>
Mother why must you do this to me!
</p>
<p>
I decline quickly and leave before I have a chance to think about it. 
</p>
<p>
The last stretch on Carling was the closest thing to hell I have ever experienced. Nothing to look at, no sidewalks to separate the traffic and I. Each step feels like I am breaking bones in my legs. I am swearing at the top of my lungs every few steps. I look like a wreck. I sit on the side of the road to finish what is left of my water.
</p>
<p>
Not a single car or cyclist is curious about the screaming student walking (if you could even call it walking at this point) where nobody has any business taking a stroll.
</p>
<p>
I continue with about two kilometres left. My legs a telling me to stop. My brain is telling me to stop but I override it. In the immense amount of pain I was feeling I found motivation and drive. I can’t go through all this and call it quits. I must keep going or the pain is for nothing.
</p>
<p>
This is where I get the phone call from my concerned mother.
</p>
<p>
“Fuck off! Fuck off! Fuck off! Fuck off!” I yell at her number on the phone. I answer it, do not say hello or wait for a reply, I just say: “I will call you when I am done,” and I hang up.
</p>
<p>
At the intersection of Carling and Herzberg Road, there is Bourk’s Complete Car Care. I decide that could be my finish line. I get a red at that last intersection. The wait feels like hours. Once the walk symbol comes on I almost fall, that brief stop waiting for the light to change stiffened up my legs. Dragging my feet across the grass I collapse in the shade of the sign out front. Unsure if this counts, I pull out my phone and start Snapchat. A Kanata filter is available. 5:00 p.m. almost on the dot. 
</p>
<p>
Good enough. This is Kanata. I reached my goal with no compromise. 
</p>
<p>
That is a wondrous feeling. 
</p>
<p>
I call my mom up and let her know she can pick me up and take me home. Thanks for supporting me while I did this mom, and I am sorry for swearing at your name on my caller ID.

<p class="cutline">Was a beautiful day to walk</p>
</div>
<p>
I learned a lot while on this nine and a half hour journey. The first half from Orleans to Parliament was amazing. It was peaceful and I found a deeper appreciation for the natural beauty around the city and inside the downtown core itself. Ottawa is a beautiful place. The river, the trees, the history, the architecture. It is all so scenic, in ways big and small. I was able to reflect on things and learn about myself. The neighbourhoods and the people. People in Kanata always joke about Orleans. We would always say there is no point in going there. Ironically, it was my favourite part of my walk. It had the best nature scenes and the friendliest people. 
</p>
<p>
On the other side, I learned a lot about what I can do if I set my mind to it. It is a cliché, but it really was my mind keeping me going. I had the drive and nothing could stop me, knowing I would eventually succeed as long as I kept putting one foot forward. No matter how small the steps, I would succeed. That is a lesson I will carry for a long time. It seems so simple when put into writing, but it is an incredibly powerful feeling. Pain is temporary, but you can be proud of what you have accomplished forever. 
</p>
<p>
I walked 42 kilometres, but it felt like at least 60. If you asked me to walk 40 kilometres before my walk, I would of politely declined. Since my walk, I feel much more open to serendipity and adventure. I want to experience new things and listen to people’s stories. 
</p>
<p>
I can’t wait to do it all again.
